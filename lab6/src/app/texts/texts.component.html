    <h1>Beauty And The Beast</h1>
    <h5>by Nighwish</h5>
      Remember the first dance we shared?<br>
      Recall the night you melted my ugliness away?<br>
      The night you left with a kiss so kind<br>
      Only a scent of beauty left behind<br><br>
      Ah dear friend I remember the night<br>
      The moon and the dreams we shared<br>
      Your trembling paw in my hand<br>
      Dreaming of that northern land<br>
      Touching me with a kiss of a beast<br><br>
      I know my dreams are made of you<br>
      Of you and only for you<br>
      Your ocean pulls me under<br>
      Your voice tears me asunder<br>
      Love me before the last petal falls<br><br>
      As a world without a glance<br>
      Of the ocean&#39;s fair expanse<br>
      Such the world would be<br>
      If no love did flow in thee<br>
      But as my heart is occupied<br>
      Your love for me now has to die<br>
      Forgive me I need more than you can offer me<br><br>
      Didn&#39;t you read the tale<br>
      Where happily ever after was to kiss a frog?<br>
      Don&#39;t you know this tale<br>
      In which all I ever wanted<br>
      I&#39;ll never have<br>
      For who could ever learn to love a beast?<br><br>
      However cold the wind and rain<br>
      I&#39;ll be there to ease your pain<br>
      However cruel the mirrors of sin<br>
      Remember beauty is found within<br><br>
      ...Forever shall the wolf in me desire the sheep in you...
